Jack London State Park,"In the heart of Sonoma Valley, Jack London State Park is a great stop to explore the ruins of the house that burned before he was able to finish it and just to walk in the footsteps of this famous author."
"Paradise Ridge Winery (destroyed in 2017 fire, so you can no longer access it)","Paradise Ridge Winery in Santa Rosa has a large collection of sculptures, many of which were taken from Burning Man and moved to this location. It is a great spot to have some wine and just to walk around and explore the property."
Snoopy’s Home Ice,"Santa Rosa is the home of Peanuts, and you can read about that here. If you just want one quick stop though, check out Snoopy’s Home Ice, which is the ice rink that Charles Schulz made for the community and which is still a famous ice rink to this day."
Ziplining in the Redwoods,"Ziplining courses are fun by themselves, but being able to do it in the view of California’s massive redwood trees is an entirely unique experience. There are multiple courses for all levels here, and the experience is pretty great."
Bumpass Hell,"The geothermal pits in Lassen National Park are a total trip. They stink, are strangely colored and are hot. It is like what you would see in Yellowstone, only in California. It is a place you need to have on your list."
Olive Pit,The Olive Pit is on here since I just always love stopping at it while I am driving in Northern California. It usually has 20 different samples of olives and another 20 samples of olive oils. It is a fun spot to go hungry too.
Weaverville Joss House State Park,"Joss House is one of the most unique state parks in the California state park system. It is a Taoist Temple from the 1850’s, and you want to make sure if you visit it that you do it when there is a tour available. The one-room temple is a very impressive site to see, but the location itself is pretty out of the way."
Bravo Farms,My go to stop while driving on Highway 99 is Bravo Farms. This magical roadside attraction has everything from shopping and restaurants to a full seven-story tall tree house that you can explore. There are even animals to feed out back if your children want to do that. I can easily spend an hour just looking at all the crazy stuff they have here.
Kingsburg Jail,"This historic jail located right off Highway 99 is a fun little stop. The jail itself is only a few rooms, and it sits under a massive Swedish Coffee Pot Water Tower. Yes, another thing you need to see to believe."
Sun-Maid Store,"The Sun-Maid Raisin store, which is located adjacent to the distribution center, holds the world’s largest raisin box on its hallowed grounds. The store also has a ton of samples that you can partake in as well and is a fun stop for a few photos."
